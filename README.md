# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My name is Josiah Janes, and I built this project to assist myself and others with quickly reviewing the prework that we were assigned for this class. This will help me in the future to tackle my assignments by having a great resource of information to draw from whenever I am stuck on a problem. In the process of making this prework study guide, I learned how to code and all of the work that goes into making a webpage.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
